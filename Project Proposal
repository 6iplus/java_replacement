Project Name:Implementing Replacement Data Structures for Java
Targets we want to achieve:
                           IntArrayList
                           DoubleArrayList
                           Map for String, double
                           Make better hash functions than java uses!

IntArrayList
    grow()
    addFirst()
    addLast()
    add()
    removeFirst()
    removeLast()
    isempty()
    get()
    contains()
DoubleArrayList
    grow()
    addFirst()
    addLast()
    add()
    removeFirst()
    removeLast()
    isempty()
    get()
    contains()
Map<String,Double>
    clear()
    containsKey()
    containsValue()
    equals()
    putAll()
    remove()
    size()
These are the data structures with their APIs we want to achieve in our project.We do these things as a group,basicaly we code together.
And the IntArrayList is been done by us.We want to design our own data structures which are faster than the java library,that is exactly 
we want to do.
